/**
How would you design a REST API for an address book? What endpoints will it have (feel free
to provide sample curl requests)? How would you handle errors?

  Example Endpoints
  Post  addressBookApi/person to add a new person
  Get   addressBookApi/person/id to return a person with an id
  Put   addressBookApi/person/id to update a person with new info
  Delete addressBookApi/person/id to delete a person

  //I would use status codes to handle errors and make sure they are numbered according to
  standards 404 not found example
