/*Describe 2 different ways of versioning REST API endpoints. Which is your preferred method
and why*/

/*1/ one method is to place an actual version number in the url itself
example myRestApi/v1/test
        myRestApi/v2/test

  another method is to have the version in the api header

     My Personal preference is to put the information in the url because it is more obvious
     to the client that something has changed and he/she will not have to play around with headers.
